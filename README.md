Project Indigo Reporting Agent - Go [Language]

This project is intended to provide an alternative data reporting engine for Project Indigo (https://www.prjindigo.com )
to what is in the prjindigo-hp website code. When looking to deploy my primary SSH attack reporting script
on a particular virtual machine, I discovered that it only had PHP 5.6.x installed and it would be a hassle to upgrade
to PHP 7.2.x. As I had been considering righting a Go language version of the reporting tool anyway, I began
this project immediately.

As Project Indigo is still under development, as is prjindigo-hp, many changes will likely take place before this code
is considered stable. Use at your own risk.
